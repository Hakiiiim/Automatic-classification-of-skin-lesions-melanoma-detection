# Automatic-classification-of-skin-lesions-melanoma-detection-

This work uses the database of the ISIC Challenge 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection.

It focuses on the third part of the challenge: Disease classification. Considering that we already have the segmented images and the superpixels of the original images.

Given the space occupied by the Database images I couldn't upload them into github, here is a link to directly download them from Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdTHZGWpA-qXyyuFjcsyqHilXCNJCwvA?usp=sharing

Both Python and Matlab are used for different classification approaches using geometric descriptors, texture descriptors and color irregularity features. A CNN is then used on pre-treated images to achieve higher accuracy.

Attached files contain two main scripts, one in Python and the other in MATLAB, the rest of the MATLAB files are functions used in the main file.

Please read the document Skin_lesion_classifier.pdf for details about the approaches used and the results obtained, it is written in LateX and in English language, the scripts are also commented in English.
