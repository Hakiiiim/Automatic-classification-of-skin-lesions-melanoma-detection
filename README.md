# Automatic-classification-of-skin-lesions-melanoma-detection-

This work uses the database of the ISIC Challenge 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection.

It focuses on the third part of the challenge: Disease classification. Considering that we already have the segmented images and the superpixels of the original images.

Given the space occupied by the Database images I couldn't upload them into github, here is a link to directly download them from Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdTHZGWpA-qXyyuFjcsyqHilXCNJCwvA?usp=sharing
